# Colorspace-Swap

## Overview

This project is a colorswapping tool which utilizes the colorspace data from an image to sort, rearrange and remap an image in order to create a replica image with swapped colorspaces. These colorspaces include: RGB, HSV, and YUV. This tool is designed to be used repeatedly and allows for images to be quickly colorswapped to fit user requirments.

## Requirements 

Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone <https://github.com/bryantolmos/Colorspace-Swap.git>
cd Colorspace-Swap
```

2. Ensure Python3.x is installed and install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##Usage

Run the code to begin swapping one colorspace to another
```bash
python colorspace_swap.py --input <input_image_path> --output <output_image_path> --colorspace <colorspace>
```

###Usage Entries

--input: Path to the input image file.
--output: Path where the output image will be saved.
--colorspace: Target color space for conversion (e.g., RGB, HSV, YUV).

##Conclusion

The Colorswapping tool can be a powerful asset to allow for quick and accessable colorswapping to streamline image processing on projects working with different colorspaces.
